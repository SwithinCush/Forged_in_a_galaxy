# Episode 1: "A New Beginning"

## Scene 1: The Arrival

##### Location: Jedi Temple, Coruscant

**Event**: Roga meets Master Alara Ven for the first time in one of the Jedi Temple's meditation chambers. Alara is calm and welcoming, but perceptive of Roga's troubled past.

**Conflict**: Alara tests Roga's patience and emotional control by asking him to meditate and clear his mind, a challenge given his doubts about his place in the Jedi Order.

**Ending**: The scene ends when Roga rolls a success when meditating, or attempts meditating three times. A messenger arrives and gives a message to Master Alara that she and Roga are wanted in the Council room. Go to scene two.

##### Threats:

1. **Inner Turmoil**: Roga’s emotional state is unstable due to his past with his previous Master, who was banished for using the Dark Side. His doubt and uncertainty threaten his ability to connect with the Force and trust in his new Master.


2. **Expectations**: Master Alara Ven's expectations for Roga are high, as she is aware of his potential and also his vulnerabilities. Her challenge to him during meditation is not just a test of his abilities but also of his willingness to follow a new path.

##### Stakes:

**Roga’s Trust in the Jedi Path**: This scene is crucial for Roga’s acceptance of Master Alara Ven’s guidance. If he fails to meet her expectations, it could deepen his sense of isolation and mistrust in the Jedi Order.

**Master Alara Ven's First Impression**: How Alara perceives Roga’s response to her test will influence her approach to training him. She needs to understand whether he is open to change or if he’s still trapped by his past teachings.

##### Resolution Paths:

**Success**: Roga manages to clear his mind, even if only briefly, and demonstrates his willingness to embrace Master Alara Ven’s teachings. This success would lead to a bond of trust beginning to form between them, with Alara offering words of encouragement and understanding.

**Partial Success**: Roga struggles with his emotions but makes a visible effort to follow Alara's instructions. Alara recognizes his struggle and respects his determination, noting that progress will take time but is possible with patience.

**Failure**: Roga fails to clear his mind and becomes frustrated or agitated. He might react defensively or withdraw into himself, reinforcing Alara's concerns about the influence of his former Master. This failure could prompt Alara to take a different, more cautious approach in future training sessions.

##### Tension Building Elements:

**Whispers from the Past**: During the meditation, Roga may hear echoes of his former Master’s teachings, pulling him toward impatience and aggression. These whispers test his focus and his resolve to follow the Light.

**Master Alara's Insight**: Alara subtly observes Roga’s reactions, probing with gentle questions to understand his fears and the depth of his emotional struggle.

##### Potential Complications:

**Force Vision**: Roga might experience a brief Force vision revealing a possible future shaped by the choices he makes in this moment, hinting at both the Light and Dark paths that lie ahead.

**Doubts and Shadows**: If Roga fails or hesitates in the meditation, a lingering doubt might settle in his mind, making him question whether he’s truly meant to be a Jedi.

## Scene 2: A Call to Action

##### Location: Jedi Council briefing room

**Event**: Master Alara receives a report from the Council about a series of mysterious disappearances in the lower levels of Coruscant. Citizens and Republic workers have gone missing, and the last reports indicate some kind of criminal syndicate involvement.

**Conflict**: Roga is eager to act but must learn to follow Master Alara's measured approach, focusing on observation and information gathering.

**Ending**: This scene ends when Roga leaves the Countil briefing room.
##### Threats:

1. **Criminal Syndicate**: A shadowy criminal organization known as the [[Midnight Consortium]] is suspected to be involved in the disappearances. They operate from the lower levels of Coruscant, using corruption and fear to maintain control.


2. **Roga’s Impatience**: Roga’s eagerness to act without fully understanding the situation could lead to impulsive decisions, putting both himself and the mission at risk.

##### Stakes:

**Safety of the Missing Citizens**: The lives of those who have disappeared hang in the balance. A hasty move could alert the criminals to the Jedi's presence, leading to further danger for the captives.

**Roga’s Discipline and Growth**: This investigation will test Roga's ability to control his impulses and follow Master Alara's guidance, developing the skills necessary to approach problems with patience and insight.

##### Resolution Paths:

**Success**: Roga follows Master Alara's lead, focusing on observation and gathering information without rushing into action. He begins to understand the value of a measured approach, gaining respect from Alara for his restraint.

**Partial Success**: Roga struggles to contain his impatience but ultimately defers to Master Alara's guidance. Though he shows some resistance, he starts to see the wisdom in her methods, acknowledging that more information is needed before they act.

**Failure**: Roga acts on his impatience, pushing for immediate action against the criminals. His rush to engage could alert the Midnight Consortium, leading to complications that put their mission and the missing citizens at greater risk.

##### Tension Building Elements:

**Signs of the Syndicate's Reach**: As Master Alara and Roga discuss their plan, they receive encrypted messages indicating that the syndicate has agents planted within Coruscant's security forces, complicating their ability to act openly.

**Subtle Lessons**: Master Alara uses the briefing as a teaching moment, challenging Roga to see beyond the surface of the problem and understand the larger implications of their mission.

##### Potential Complications:

**False Leads**: As they start their investigation, misleading information from corrupt informants or desperate citizens could steer them away from the true source of the disappearances.

**Political Pressure**: The Jedi Council receives pressure from influential figures in Coruscant to handle the situation discreetly, making it even more critical for Roga to learn restraint.
