### Character Name: CT-6174 "Bolt"

**Species:** Human (Clone)  
**Gender:** Male  
**Age:** Late 20s (Physically appears in his prime due to accelerated aging)  
**Appearance:** Bolt is built like the typical clone trooper, with a muscular, athletic frame and the standard features shared by all clones of Jango Fett. What sets him apart is a confident and slightly mischievous smile that rarely leaves his face, even in the heat of battle. His eyes are a striking shade of blue with a hint of sharp focus, giving away his keen tactical mind. Bolt has a small, distinctive scar above his right eyebrow—a reminder of a close call during a previous mission. His armor is standard Phase II clone trooper armor, but it's heavily customized with blue markings and a lightning bolt insignia painted on the left shoulder, symbolizing his quick reflexes and speed in battle.

### Personality:
Bolt has a reputation among his fellow clones as a risk-taker and a bit of a maverick. He approaches combat with a mix of precision and daring, always looking for unconventional ways to outsmart his enemies. His nickname, "Bolt," comes not only from his quick reflexes and speed in combat but also from his tendency to strike fast and move before his opponents can react. While he’s fiercely loyal to the Republic, Bolt doesn’t always follow orders to the letter, preferring to adapt on the fly and rely on his instincts.

Despite his rebellious streak, Bolt is deeply loyal to his brothers in arms and any allies he fights alongside. He has a sharp wit and a sense of humor that can lighten even the most intense situations, making him a morale booster for those around him. Bolt isn’t afraid to challenge authority if he believes there’s a better way to achieve their goals, which sometimes puts him at odds with more traditional Jedi like Master Alara Ven.

### Skills and Abilities:
- **Expert Marksman:** Bolt is highly skilled with blasters and projectile weapons, able to hit precise targets even in the most chaotic of firefights. His quick reflexes and steady aim make him a deadly force on the battlefield.
- **Explosives Specialist:** Known for his ingenuity with grenades and improvised explosives, Bolt can turn the tide of a battle with well-placed detonations that disrupt enemy formations.
- **Tactical Genius:** Bolt's ability to analyze a situation and come up with unconventional tactics makes him a valuable asset in combat. He excels in small-unit tactics, often finding ways to turn the environment to his advantage.
- **Close-Quarters Combat:** Though his primary strength is at range, Bolt is no stranger to close-quarters combat. He can hold his own in hand-to-hand encounters, using quick strikes and his agility to outmaneuver opponents.

### Background:
Bolt was part of a highly specialized unit of clone troopers trained to operate in urban environments, making him particularly adept at navigating the complex underworld of Coruscant. His experience in urban combat has made him an expert at blending into crowds, setting up ambushes, and using the terrain to his advantage. Over time, Bolt developed a reputation as the trooper you call in when the mission requires a mix of creativity, speed, and precision.

After a devastating ambush that left his unit scattered, Bolt found himself separated from his brothers. Since then, he has operated semi-independently, taking on missions that involve tracking down targets and gathering intelligence in the lower levels of Coruscant. His path crosses with Roga Danar and Master Alara Ven during their investigation into the missing Republic intelligence officer, where his skills and daring personality quickly prove to be invaluable.

### Relationship with Roga Danar:
Bolt sees a bit of himself in Roga—young, determined, and struggling to find his place in a world that demands more than straightforward solutions. He respects Roga's potential but also enjoys challenging the Padawan's more rigid thinking, encouraging him to take risks and trust his instincts. Bolt’s unorthodox methods often clash with Master Alara Ven’s disciplined approach, creating an interesting dynamic that pushes Roga to find a balance between the two influences.

Bolt's lighthearted demeanor and courage in battle serve as a counterbalance to Roga's self-doubt and internal struggles. While Bolt may not fully understand the complexities of the Force, he believes in Roga’s abilities and supports him in finding his own way as a Jedi.

### Current Status:
Bolt is currently on a personal mission to find his missing brothers from the ambushed unit. Though he remains loyal to the Republic, his time apart from the main army has given him a unique perspective on the war and the moral complexities involved. Bolt is driven by a sense of loyalty and justice, not just to the Republic but to those he fights alongside, making him a steadfast ally to Roga and Alara as they face the challenges ahead.
