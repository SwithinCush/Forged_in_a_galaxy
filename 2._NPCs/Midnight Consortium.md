### Midnight Consortium

**Overview:** The Midnight Consortium is a shadowy criminal organization operating in the lower levels of Coruscant. Known for their secrecy and ruthlessness, they have established a network of influence that extends into various sectors of the city, including trade, security, and politics. Their operations are shrouded in mystery, and they are adept at evading law enforcement and Jedi scrutiny.

**Leadership:** The Consortium is rumored to be led by a figure known only as "The Veil," whose identity remains unknown. The Veil is said to be a master strategist, orchestrating the Consortium's activities from the shadows and ensuring that their operations remain hidden from prying eyes.

**Activities:** The Midnight Consortium is involved in a wide range of illicit activities, including smuggling, extortion, and trafficking. They are known to exploit the chaos and anonymity of the lower levels to conduct their operations, often using fear and intimidation to maintain control over their territories.

**Structure:** The Consortium operates through a network of cells, each led by a lieutenant who reports directly to The Veil. This decentralized structure makes it difficult for authorities to dismantle the organization, as each cell functions independently and can continue operations even if one is compromised.

**Influence:** The Consortium has infiltrated various levels of Coruscant's infrastructure, using bribery and coercion to place agents within key positions. This influence allows them to manipulate events to their advantage and stay one step ahead of their adversaries.

**Reputation:** Among the denizens of the lower levels, the Midnight Consortium is both feared and respected. They are known for their swift and brutal enforcement of their rules, and those who cross them often disappear without a trace. Despite their criminal nature, some view them as a necessary evil, providing order in areas where the Republic's reach is limited.

**Current Threat:** The recent disappearances, including that of Jaren Korr, have been linked to the Consortium, suggesting that they may be expanding their operations or involved in a new, more sinister venture. Their motives remain unclear, but their actions have drawn the attention of the Jedi Council, prompting an investigation.
